# ARDUINO-CAR-BOT
So I have made a Car BOT with the help of arduino. Its an easy project and can be merely completed in 2-3 hours by those who have a mere understanding of arduino

All threads are welcomed who could modify the code and make the Bot more advance.

The code is uploaded in the file named "CODE".

THE BOT is being controlled by a remote. 
The parts required are being mentioned in the seperate file.
